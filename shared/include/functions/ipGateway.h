// Addressing, chosen at compile time. Each range is a base address and a prefix length of 8 to 24 bits, and maps the
// low bits of the address to a DMR ID. Bigger IDs are truncated: in a /16 radio 0x010203 is x.y.2.3, and its host also
// gets the data sent to radio 0x0203. Sending from the host to x.y.2.3 reaches 0x0203 only.
//   individual   11.0.0.0/8 (default)  DMR IDs. The host gets its own radio's ID by DHCP, so radio 10005 gives it
//                                      11.0.39.21 (or 10.250.39.21 with 10.250.0.0/16). Over the air the packets keep
//                                      the Motorola CAI addresses (12.x.y.z, 225.x.y.z), see dmrData.c
//   multicast    225.0.0.0/8           talkgroups, both ways: send to 225.x.y.z for talkgroup x.y.z, and group data
//                                      received over the air arrives there (join the group on the radio's interface)
//   link         /32 (default)         the host alone: the host is 11.<ID>/32, the radio is 11.<ID> xor 1, and option
//                                      121 has a route to the radio on the link (router 0.0.0.0) and routes the
//                                      individual, multicast (and group) ranges through the radio. Each radio has an
//                                      address of its own, so several radios can be plugged into one host. The radio
//                                      answers at that address for ping, DHCP and IPGW_SERIAL_PORT only, anything else
//                                      to it goes over the air to the radio with that ID. The radio answers ARP for
//                                      every address but the host's, in case the host ignores the on link route.
//                or /31                the same with the host and the radio as a /31 (RFC 3021), the radio answering
//                                      ARP for its own address only. macOS treats both ends of a /31 as broadcast
//                                      addresses, so sending to the radio needs SO_BROADCAST there.
//                or /1 to the individual prefix, holding the individual range (e.g. IPGW_LINK_PREFIX 8), for hosts
//                                      that can't use a /31: every radio is on the link and the radio itself is the
//                                      top individual address but one (11.255.255.254), so that ID can't be used. One
//                                      radio per host. Option 121 routes the multicast range (and the group range when
//                                      it is off the link).
//   group        none (optional)       a unicast range for sending to talkgroups, for hosts or apps that can't use the
//                                      multicast route, e.g. 10.251.0.0/16 next to 10.250.0.0/16.
//                                      Define IPGW_GROUP_NET and IPGW_GROUP_PREFIX to have it.
// The top individual address (11.255.255.255) is the all call (16777215), for the DMR application ports 4000-4099
// only; as are 255.255.255.255 and, on a shared link, the subnet broadcast. Received all calls and monitor records go
// to the host's broadcast address: the subnet broadcast on a shared link, 255.255.255.255 on a /31 or /32.
